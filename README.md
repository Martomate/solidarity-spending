# Solidarity Spending
Solidarity Spending is a web-app that gives you simple insight on what it takes for a small business to survive and helps you and your friends to spread/adjust your spending more evenly, to help small businesses stay afloat.

## Hack the Crisis
The website was made during Hack the Crisis Sweden 2020, which was a hackathon dedicated to helping society through the difficult times of the Covid-19 outbreak of 2020.

## Progress
So far the website is quite far from what was planned for it. It should be seen more as a demo.

The website can be seen [here](https://solidarity-spending.herokuapp.com).
